=head1 NAME

RPGCat::Model::EMKit - Catalyst model for sending emails

https://github.com/simonamor/catalyst-example-email/

=head1 METHODS

=cut

our $AUTOLOAD;

__PACKAGE__->config( class => "RPGCat::EMKit" );

has 'EmailInstance' => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => 'RPGCat::EMKit',
);

has 'from_email' => (
    is => 'ro',
    isa => 'Str',
    default => 'rpgcat@localhost',
);
has 'from_name' => (
    is => 'ro',
    isa => 'Str',
    default => 'RPGCat',
);


=head2 default_transport
You will almost definitely want to use something that isn't
Email::Sender::Transport::Test during normal use otherwise
you won't get any emails!
=cut

has 'default_transport' => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => 'Str',
    default => 'Email::Sender::Transport::Test',
);

has 'default_transport_args' => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => Maybe[HashRef],
    default => undef,
);

=head2 ACCEPT_CONTEXT

This ensures that any requests for $c->model('EMKit') return a fresh
object that hasn't already been referenced.

=cut

# One instance per $c->model() request
sub ACCEPT_CONTEXT {
    my ($self, $c, @args) = @_;
    my $emkit = RPGCat::EMKit->new(
        template_path => $c->path_to('templates', 'email')->stringify,
        default_from_name => $self->from_name,
        default_from_email => $self->from_email,
        transport_class => $self->default_transport,
        transport_args => $self->default_transport_args,
        @args );

    return $emkit;
}

=head2 AUTOLOAD

Any methods requested are passed through to RPGCat::EMKit

=cut

sub AUTOLOAD {
    my $self = shift;
    my $name = $AUTOLOAD;
    $name =~ s/.*://;
    $self->EmailInstance->$name(@_);
}
